Chat GPT:
Exaone 2.0 includes several advanced safeguard mechanisms to minimize bias and ensure the accuracy of its outputs:

* Bias Detection and Mitigation: Exaone 2.0 is built to prevent hallucinations (the generation of 
 false information) by referencing a vast database of reliable sources, including 45 million 
 theses, patents, and other literature, along with 350 million images. This extensive dataset 
 helps provide contextually accurate responses and reduces the risk of biased or incorrect outputs​
 (Korea JoongAng Daily)​.

* Multilingual Capabilities: The model supports both Korean and English, enhancing its ability to 
 understand and process diverse inputs more effectively, which can contribute to reducing 
 language-based biases​ (LG AI Research)​.

* Professional and Expert Insights: By focusing on professional applications in fields such as 
 chemistry, biology, medicine, finance, and patents, Exaone 2.0 aims to deliver specialized and 
 reliable information. This targeted approach helps ensure that the outputs are grounded in 
 verified data and expert knowledge​ (Korea JoongAng Daily)​​ (LG AI Research)​.

* Transparent Answer Generation: Exaone 2.0 provides insights along with references to the 
 original sources, allowing users to verify the information. This transparency is crucial for 
 maintaining trust and credibility​ (Korea JoongAng Daily)​.

* Advanced Image and Document Processing: The platform can process and understand complex 
 scientific documents, including molecular structures and formulas, reducing the chance of 
 misinterpretation and ensuring accurate data handling​ (LG AI Research)​.
