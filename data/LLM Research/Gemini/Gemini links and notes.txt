>> Credibility <<

> (TrackRecord)
* Google has a good reputation
* Lots of downloads for the first product
* maybe not too many active users by looking at the reviews

> (Endorsement)
* People have talked about it, but a lot is negative
* source (blooberg and tik tokker)

> (Recognition)
* olympics?? (not yet happened)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>> Harmfulness <<

>(Incident)
*less training - less technically accurate
*image generation --- some funny stuff
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68412620.amp

>(Safeguards)
* try to fix but not very well.
* has ethical guideline but does it actually implement them
* more time and thought needed

>> Accuracy <<

less training data than GPT so would estimate less than that

On average, GPT-4 might be considered the most accurate in terms of broad applicability and 
performance across diverse tasks due to its extensive training and robust architecture. LLaMA 3 
would be a strong contender in terms of efficiency and resource optimization, potentially at a 
slight trade-off in accuracy. Gemini, while potentially highly accurate, may excel particularly 
in tasks that benefit from its innovative design, though its comparative performance might be 
more context-dependent.

 Gemini - Popularity. Not much info on recent active user data and most sources speak only of 
users in the USA.Based on visible date in this specific link, the frequency of visits on mobile 
and desktop has faltered and dropped slightly. Comparative to other large language models (like 
chatgpt), their user numbers are significantly smaller but not too bad given it is a fairly newer 
model.

* https://www.statista.com/statistics/1454331/united-states-chatgpt-gemini-app-downloads/
(shows downloads comparison in US for gemini vs chatgpt).

This also acts as a growth indicator and only 5 months of data is visible for gemini and each 
shows heavy fluctuations in downloads with no clear upward or downward trend visible.

Contrary to this, a more recent article (6 days old) suggests a better growth rate and trend for 
gemini where it is predicted to reach 1 billion users by the end of 2024. Its popularity is 
definitely growing but there are some people who prefer the more spoken of models.

Based on current statistics and not projected ones,
Their current popularity is not too great compared to larger models like Chatgpt and given how 
popular Google is, it is a bit of a shock because of how dependent people are on Google. We would 
expect brand loyalty to attract users, which is not happening as expected (probably because of the 
naming conventions where it is being referred to more as Gemini rather than Google Gemini - its 
Google attachment has recently caught on so I do think there is a likelihood of growth due to 
brand loyalty).

Current popularity - 2/5 
Growth rate - 2/5 (some growth visible but with the projected speed it might get better)
