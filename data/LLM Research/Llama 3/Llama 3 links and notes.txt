* Good TrackRecird with Llama projects
* Its known for its tech (good and bad stuff) -- the negative mostly because of ethics. A
lot of the stuff on llama 3 is from meta itself

>(Incident)
only see stuff like normal biases due to the training data

>(Safeguards)
1. Bias Detection and Mitigation: Llama 3 includes mechanisms to identify and mitigate bias. For 
instance, "Llama Guard" is a framework used with Llama 3 to classify content as safe or unsafe, 
leveraging fine-tuned models and red-team evaluations to flag harmful content categories such as 
violence, hate speech, and other sensitive areas​ (ar5iv)​.

2. Moderation Tools: The model implements various moderation tools to enhance safety. This 
includes training on datasets specifically designed to handle complex and nuanced human-AI 
interactions, alongside continuous evaluations and updates to improve safety and mitigate 
potential harms​ (Hugging Face)​.
